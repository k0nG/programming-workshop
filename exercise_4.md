#Exercise 4

You have now finished the main exercises. Here are some extra tasks:

 - Did you write automated tests? If not go back and add them.
 - If you wrote tests go back and review your code, see if there's anything you want to refactor.
 - Rewrite you program in a different language for comparison. Or try writing your program using functional programming.

If all of these sound boring then alternatively you can move on to exercise 5 which has nothing to do with TV schedules.
