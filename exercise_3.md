#Exercise 3
The client is so happy with the work you've done they've commissioned some new features. Congratulations!

Their in-house dev team have written a GUI which runs your program. Unfortunately only some of their in-house dev team understand unix timestamps so they want to be able to pass the timestamp in the format "2016-01-26 10:36:09" or as a unix timestamp.

##Example
For example, given the inputs:

 - tv_schedule_1.csv
 - "2016-01-26 21:03:09"

The output should be "Silent Witness" and 189.

##Assumptions

 - Any timestamps provided are in UTC

## Exercise 3.1
For the input "2016-01-26 13:22:11" what TV Show is playing?

## Exercise 3.2
For the input "2016-01-26 15:53:34" what TV Show is playing?
